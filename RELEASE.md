# Release Process

alltz uses GitHub Actions for automated cross-platform releases.

## Automated Release Process

### 1. Create a Release

To create a new release:

```bash
# Update version in Cargo.toml if needed
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: bump version to v0.2.0"

# Create and push tag
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) automatically:

1. **Builds for multiple platforms:**
   - macOS Intel (x86_64-apple-darwin)
   - macOS ARM64 (aarch64-apple-darwin) 
   - Linux (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu)
   - Windows (x86_64-pc-windows-msvc)

2. **Creates release artifacts:**
   - Platform-specific tarballs (.tar.gz for Unix, .zip for Windows)
   - SHA256 checksums for all binaries
   - GitHub release with changelog

3. **Prepares Homebrew formula:**
   - Automatically updates `homebrew-tap/Formula/alltz.rb`
   - Updates SHA256 hashes for macOS binaries
   - Creates **DRAFT** pull request for review

### 3. Manual Steps

After the automated release:

1. **Review GitHub Release:** Check the auto-generated release notes and artifacts
2. **Test Homebrew Formula:** Review the draft PR and test the formula:
   ```bash
   # Test the updated formula locally
   brew install --build-from-source ./homebrew-tap/Formula/alltz.rb
   ```
3. **Update Linux SHA256:** If needed, update the Linux hash in the formula
4. **Publish to Homebrew:** When ready, mark the PR as ready for review and merge
5. **Announce:** Share the release in relevant channels

### 4. Controlled Homebrew Release

The workflow creates a **draft PR** so you have full control:
- ‚úÖ GitHub release is published immediately
- ‚è≥ Homebrew formula changes are staged in a draft PR
- üéõÔ∏è You decide when to make the formula available to users

## Homebrew Installation Options

### Option 1: Precompiled Binaries (Default)
```bash
brew tap abradburne/alltz
brew install alltz
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
For users who prefer building from source or need custom compilation:
```bash
brew tap abradburne/alltz
brew install --HEAD alltz
```

This requires Rust to be available and will compile from the latest main branch.

## Local Development Builds

For local testing during development:

```bash
# Quick local build for your architecture
./release-local.sh

# Or standard cargo build
cargo build --release
```

## Troubleshooting

### Cross-compilation Issues
If you need to build locally for multiple platforms, install targets first:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin aarch64-apple-darwin x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

Linux cross-compilation from macOS requires additional setup (linkers, etc.) which is why we recommend using GitHub Actions for production builds.

### GitHub Actions Failures
Common issues:
- Missing `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions (should be automatic)
- Version conflicts (ensure tag matches version in files)
- Target platform build failures (check Rust toolchain compatibility)

### Homebrew Formula Issues
- SHA256 mismatches: The workflow calculates these automatically
- Binary naming: Ensure GitHub Actions outputs match formula expectations
- Dependencies: Only `rust` is required for source builds
